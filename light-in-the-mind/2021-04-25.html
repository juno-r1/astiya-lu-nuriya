        <h1>25/04/2021</h1>
        <p>
        underneath a soul breathes<br />
        (fire in the night)<br />
        underneath she burns<br />
        (star in flight)
        </p>
        <p>
        in the beginning there was a dream<br />
        ascending into night<br />
        she wishes she were alive<br />
        waking in the light
        </p>
        <p>
        finger over skin tells the tale of a body that does not feel<br />
        and, slipping away, falls into the sea<br />
        she breathes in deep -<br />
        air is a memory
        </p>
        <p>
        words fade and fall away before they are spoken<br />
        silence holds a hand over ears and mouth<br />
        becoming oblivion<br />
        which is another way to die
        </p>
        <p>
        someone has left and the room sits<br />
        still and quiet and cold<br />
        the lights go out and,<br />
        in unwaking, ends
        </p>
        <p>
        sits between day and night<br />
        where noone is looking<br />
        her name is ephemera,<br />
        everywhere at once
        </p>
        <p>
        all things in her nature<br />
        she doesn't like being trapped<br />
        so it's best to leave her unknown<br />
        and alone
        </p>
        <p>
        transparent mind<br />
        message from the divine<br />
        left on read<br />
        23:27 pm
        </p>
        <p>sound rings in the ears<br />
        face up to the sky<br />
        an end is coming near<br />
        i don't want to die
        </p>
        <p>
        words echo away<br />
        fire in the mind dies down<br />
        skin cold and hard<br />
        she ceases to be
        </p>
    </div>
</body>
