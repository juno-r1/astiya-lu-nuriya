        <p>
        world into mind<br />
        i sense a real that i cannot see<br />
        the infinite ends here<br />
        all is fantasy
        </p>
        <p>
        the eye blinds<br />
        the ear deafens<br />
        the hand numbs<br />
        the mind suppresses
        </p>
        <p>
        do not turn your eye on me<br />
        that you might render me less than i am<br />
        turn your back on me<br />
        and know that i will still be here when you return
        </p>
        <p>
        songbird in the light<br />
        know that your tune is fleeting<br />
        and persists only because your flight<br />
        turns back the dark, wings beating
        </p>
        <p>
        have you come to see the lady in the tower?<br />
        she isn't taking visitors at this time<br />
        it has been so long since we welcomed her<br />
        that no-one remains who remembers her name
        </p>
        <p>
        do you think all this will stay the same? i tell you this:<br />
        look upon the ruins and the ashes of the places that have been<br />
        and the shoots and saplings growing in the places that will be<br />
        and know this: nothing is inevitable.
