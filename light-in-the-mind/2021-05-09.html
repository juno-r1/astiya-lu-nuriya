        <p>
        i am already beginning to forget<br />
        she is someone i could never be<br />
        running, escaping, fleeing<br />
        and free
        </p>
        <p>
        all the lights die down<br />
        black sky fades to grey<br />
        when the night is over<br />
        nothing else can stay
        </p>
        <p>
        morning comes<br />
        beset by the tyranny of light<br />
        i am not ready for the world<br />
        leave me in the night
        </p>
        <p>
        her face is mine<br />
        bright-eyed and alive<br />
        but when the dream departs<br />
        the mask, cold and dead, returns
        </p>
        <p>
        we were not made for infinity<br />
        we do not bear its weight<br />
        memory takes the bits it wants<br />
        and throws the rest away
        </p>
        <p>
        my name is my own<br />
        but i am many things<br />
        and a simple word does not suffice<br />
        to describe me
        </p>
        <p>
        memories over memories<br />
        past over past<br />
        the mind is a knife and it cuts through me<br />
        like i'm barely there at all
        </p>
        <p>
        many minds in one<br />
        bleeding over my eyes<br />
        too loud to bear<br />
        i am losing the real
        </p>
        <p>
        i remember most things<br />
        good or bad<br />
        but i am beginning to forget<br />
        how they fit together
        </p>
        <p>
        i am screaming inside my mind<br />
        every day for nine years<br />
        and i have never broken<br />
        i wish i could remember how to stop
        </p>
